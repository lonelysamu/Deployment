          <p>Come up with project proposal and execution plans for the events the company aims to be involved in or plan to run.
            Come up with events, activity, workshop ideas for the events/projects the company plan to be involved in or run.
            <br>
            Advisor for all things tech related during event/activity planning and discussion
            <br>
            Here is a list of content generated/lead so far that has taken off:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. #codeathome : a coding tutorial for kids amidst the covid 19 lockdown, centered around scratch via making simple games. For this project, I was the main content creator, generating the code for the games, and then simplifying it, so that it isn't too intimidating for kids to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. #codingdirumah : similar to #codeathome, this is a collaboration between astro and synapze with the aim of teaching kids coding using scratch via game dev through a competition amidst this covid19 lockdown. I was the main content creator, generating the code for the games and then simplifying it so that it isn't too intimidating for the kids to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. #codeathome tutor programme: a webinar for kids and teachers, based around the contents of the #codingdirumah scratch programs. Using the program, we guide the kids to complete the projects, as well as, teach them how to customize the games into the games they want to make. The program is roughly a hour long, hosted by me.

          <h2>sandbox.asia (1 year 4 months)</h2>
          <h2>Head of Education</h2>
          <p>As the Head of Education,
            I am tasked with ensuring all content developed by each stream (Robotics, Game Development, App Development and Streaming) falls inline with the mission and vision of sandbox.asia. Along with that, i am also in charge of hiring personnel to fulfill current and potential needs, as well as look out for individuals, business and entities which may lead to fruitful outcomes.
            So far, I have been responsible for the liasoning between:
            <br>
            <br>
            St John International School, (robotics, game development & tech4.0 classes)
            <br>
            Al hamra Integrated School (game development and robotics ECA programme)
            <br>
            Stem4all Makerspace (workshop & weekend classes)
            <br>
            Sri Desa Learning Centre (Robotics ECA & CCA classes)</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Robotics Lead</h2>
            <p>As the robotics lead for Sandbox.asia,
              My job was to develop and subsequently teach the robotics course for people from differing age groups The courses that were developed centered around the Arduino Uno with the goal of enabling children/teens to be able to build anything using whatever they can find around them.
              <br>
              So far, we have developed programmes for:
              <br>
              <br>
              Junior Programme : 6-9 years old
              <br>
              Youth Programme : 10-14 years old
              <br>
